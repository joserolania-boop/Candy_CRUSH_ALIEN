Place audio assets here to use real ambient/effect files.

Supported filenames (used by the game):
- ambient.mp3   -> background music (looping)
- swap.wav      -> swap sound effect
- match.wav     -> match/clear sound effect

If you add these files at `assets/audio/ambient.mp3` etc, the game will prefer them and crossfade from the synth to the audio file.

Audio file tips:
- Keep `ambient.mp3` short and loopable (2-5 minutes recommended).
- Use small WAV files for effects (e.g., 100-300ms).
- For testing, you can copy any MP3/WAV and rename it accordingly.
